# Absenteeism Project 
<br/><h2>Case</h2> 
<p>Predict Absenteeism at a company during work time. We would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing (absent) for a specific number of hours in a given work day </p><br/>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time and to explain the reason behind Absenteeism. Absenteeism is the absence from work during normal working hours, resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity </p><br/>
